  <h1>Comic-Con Anniversary Reflection</h1>

  <p>This July will mark a very important anniversary for me. This marks my tenth consecutive year attending the San Diego Comic-Con. I feel fortunate to have been able to attend so many with my family. This event has not only been fun but also helped shape me to who I am today.</p>

  <h2>Comic-Con Culture</h2>

  <p>Sometimes it brings in hundreds of thousands more than can even attend the conference and participate in what are called off-sites, which are typically free to go to and will give out free swag to visitors.</p>

  <p>Here you can see the local news coverage from last year.</p>

  <p>Over the years, attendance at the San Diego Comic-Con has increased significantly. It is not hard to see why, as our popular culture, in movies, books, and on TV, has increasingly focused on comic book characters and stories. This amazing chart by Gursevak Ajay Singh Dhanda breaks down this popularity.</p>
